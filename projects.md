# Projects
## Complexity Theory of Solvers
The [Complexity Theory of Solvers](https://satcomplexity.github.io/) project aims to bridge the practice and theory of SAT.

## Z3 String Solver
The [Z3 string solver](https://sites.google.com/site/z3strsolver/getting-started) is a constraint solver for the quantifier-free theory of string equations, the regular-expression membership predicates, and linear arithmetic over the length functions. Z3 string solver is implemented as a string theory plug-in of the powerful Z3 SMT solver.

## MathCheck
[MathCheck](https://uwaterloo.ca/mathcheck/) is a combination of the computer algebra system (CAS) SAGE with a SAT Solver. Users can define predicates in the language of the CAS which can be finitely verified in a loop by the SAT solver, analogous to basic SMT approaches.

## MapleCrypt
[MapleCrypt](https://sites.google.com/site/maplecrypt/) is a SAT-based tool for cryptanalysis of cryptographic primitives. Currently it is focused on inverting cryptographic hash functions. The main two techniques that are developed in SATCrypt are a CEGAR-based approach and using an adaptive restart policy.

## Ampharos
[MapleAmpharos](https://sites.google.com/site/mapleampharos/) is an extension to the AMPHAROS parallel SAT solver with a powerful propagation rate based splitting heuristic.

## PaInleSS
PArallel INstantiabLE Sat Solver ([PaInleSS](http://painless.lrde.epita.fr/)) is a framework written in C++ that simplifies the implementation and evaluation of new parallel SAT solvers for many-core environments including MapleCOMSPS.

## STP
[STP](https://github.com/stp/stp) is a constraint solver (or SMT solver) aimed at solving constraints of bitvectors and arrays. These types of constraints can be generated by program analysis tools, theorem provers, automated bug finders, cryptographic attack tools, intelligent fuzzers, model checkers, and by many other applications.

The Maple series of solvers provides efficient behind-the-scenes reasoning for STP.

## Laser
[Laser](https://github.com/sat-group/laser-maple) is a suite of tools to compute LSR-backdoors, built on top of the MapleSat SAT solver.
