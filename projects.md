# Other Projects
## Z3 String Solver
The [Z3 string solver](https://sites.google.com/site/z3strsolver/getting-started) is a constraint solver for the quantifier-free theory of string equations, the regular-expression membership predicates, and linear arithmetic over the length functions. Z3 string solver is implemented as a string theory plug-in of the powerful Z3 SMT solver.

## MathCheck
[MathCheck](https://uwaterloo.ca/mathcheck/) is a combination of the computer algebra system (CAS) SAGE with a SAT Solver. Users can define predicates in the language of the CAS which can be finitely verified in a loop by the SAT solver, analogous to basic SMT approaches.

## MapleCrypt
[MapleCrypt](https://sites.google.com/site/maplecrypt/) is a SAT-based tool for cryptanalysis of cryptographic primitives. Currently it is focused on inverting cryptographic hash functions. The main two techniques that are developed in SATCrypt are a CEGAR-based approach and using an adaptive restart policy.

## Ampharos
[MapleAmpharos](https://sites.google.com/site/mapleampharos/) is an extension to the AMPHAROS parallel SAT solver with a powerful propagation rate based splitting heuristic.

## PaInleSS
PArallel INstantiabLE Sat Solver ([PaInleSS](http://painless.lrde.epita.fr/)) is a framework written in C++ that simplifies the implementation and evaluation of new parallel SAT solvers for many-core environments including MapleCOMSPS.
