# Applications
## STP
[STP](https://github.com/stp/stp) is a constraint solver (or SMT solver) aimed at solving constraints of bitvectors and arrays. These types of constraints can be generated by program analysis tools, theorem provers, automated bug finders, cryptographic attack tools, intelligent fuzzers, model checkers, and by many other applications.

The Maple series of solvers provides efficient behind-the-scenes reasoning for STP.

## MapleCrypt
[MapleCrypt](https://sites.google.com/site/maplecrypt/) is a SAT-based tool for cryptanalysis of cryptographic primitives. Currently it is focused on inverting cryptographic hash functions. The main two techniques that are developed in SATCrypt are a CEGAR-based approach and using an adaptive restart policy.

## Laser
[Laser](https://github.com/sat-group/laser-maple) is a suite of tools to compute LSR-backdoors, built on top of the MapleSat SAT solver.
